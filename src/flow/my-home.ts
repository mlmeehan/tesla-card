 * (never emit a gap line inside a card or above the source bottom). Honors the

 * `Number.isFinite` (never read as `0`). NB the finite-filter catches only
 * non-finite coords — a finite all-zeros rect from an in-DOM-but-unlaid-out child
 * (`getBoundingClientRect()` → `{0,0,0,0}`) slips PAST it, but the overlap guard
 * is the safety net: an unlaid-out load at `top≈0` collapses `minTop→0 ≤ maxBottom`

 * `sceneAggregates` (one `computeBalance`) for `consumption` + the grid term, so
 * the lead, the per-node tiles, and the bus can never disagree (the 6.6
 * agree-by-construction invariant, extended).
 *
 * Formula: `gridImport = max(0, grid net)` (0 when the grid is absent OR exporting);
 * `selfKw = max(0, consumption − gridImport)`; `pct = round(selfKw / consumption ×
 * 100)`, clamped 0–100.
 *
 * Honesty (AC2): when total consumption is sub-`IDLE_KW` (a fully-quiescent Scene or
 * a generation-only export tick — there is nothing to be a percentage *of*), `pct`
 * is `undefined` (the caller renders an honest `—`), NEVER a divide-by-zero rounded
 * to `0`/`100`. Grid exporting / islanded ⇒ no import covers any load ⇒ the home IS
 * fully self-powered ⇒ `pct === 100` (honest, not a fabrication). NaN-safe by
 * construction (the nets are already coerced to `0` for missing reads upstream).
